# UnityWeldKR : extensions, bug fixes and updates for UnityWeld
This project is a original fork of [UnityWeld(Real-Serious-Games)](https://github.com/Real-Serious-Games/Unity-Weld) with the goal of being actively maintained.

## Introduction
This project aims to provide a robust and efficient data binding solution for Unity developers, facilitating seamless integration and synchronization between data models and UI components.

## Why Data Binding?
In Unity development, managing the state and synchronization of UI components with data models can be challenging and error-prone. Our Data Binding System addresses these challenges by offering:
- Ease of Use: Simple and intuitive APIs to bind data models with UI components.
- Flexibility: Support for various data types and custom binding behaviors.
- Performance: Optimized for minimal overhead and efficient updates.
- Scalability: Suitable for small projects to large-scale applications with complex UI structures.

## Key Features
Key Features
- Automatic Updates: Automatically updates UI elements when the underlying data changes.
- One-Way Binding: Supports one-way data binding, ensuring that changes in the in the data models are reflected to UI.
- Two-Way Binding: Supports two-way data binding, ensuring that changes in the UI are reflected in the data model.
- Event Binding: Supports event-binding, which sends UI event to data binding function.
- Customizable: Easily extendable to support custom data types and binding rules.
